    		<p>Buying chicken can be a tricky task to do. While buying chicken, make sure the chicken parts are tender, moist and plump. The whole chicken and its parts should have a clean smell. Before buying the chicken don't forget to check the date of package and don't buy if there is too much volume of liquid in the package or the chicken seems to be sticky or smells suspicion. The colour of the chicken however isn't really an accurate indicator of the quality as it varies from region to region and depends on the breed and feed of it. However whatever the colour of the chicken is, it shouldn't appear to be transparent or mottled.</p>
